# String Library in C: A Learning Project

This project is a simple exploration into C programming, with a focus on string manipulation, memory management, and creating header files. It's a personal exercise and not meant to be a comprehensive or production-ready library.

## About

The string library provides a basic set of operations for working with strings. The aim was to wrap the traditional `char*` strings into a more manageable `string` struct, which includes not only the character data but also metadata such as length and capacity.

## Features

- **Dynamic Strings**: This library allows strings to grow and shrink dynamically.
  
- **Memory Management**: An introduction into manual memory management in C, ensuring allocations and deallocations are handled.
  
- **String Operations**: Basic functions for string manipulation such as concatenation, trimming, and case conversions.

## Usage

1. Include the `string_lib.h` header in your C program.
2. Use the provided functions to create and manipulate strings.
3. Link your program with `string_lib.c` during compilation.

## Note

This is a learning project and is primarily for personal use and understanding. It's not optimized or exhaustive in its capabilities.
